# BarClimb Project Handoff

## Current state
Milestone 1 is in progress. M1.1/M1.1a established and corrected the multi-client repository/toolchain foundation: a minimal Django/DRF backend, React web shell, Expo React Native shell, enforceably portable TypeScript packages, deterministic locks, repeatable checks, and PostgreSQL-backed foundation CI. No BarClimb business domain, authentication, provider integration, or deployment behavior has been implemented.

## Authoritative contracts
See `../specs/SPEC_MANIFEST.json`. Four Markdown specs control the build.

## Completed through repository kickoff
- Product/architecture/learning/network/native requirements consolidated.
- Ten acceptance milestones organized into six launch trains.
- Repository continuity/recovery system defined.
- Five coverage safeguards machine-specified: immutable official source artifacts, literal scope manifest, bidirectional mapping, maturity-based inventory coverage, and strict CI/release validation.
- Second-pass safeguards added: Rule Obligation Catalog, primary/exam authority mapping, automated multi-source reconciliation, optional enhanced NCBE Sourcebook reconciliation when lawfully available, subject coverage certification, assessment coverage-target confirmation, source-drift monitoring, provisional exam-target handling, and reproducible CoverageReleaseSnapshots.
- Three-scenario system audit completed: anonymous SEO discovery, signed-in Free, and Plus now share canonical models/assessment truth with server-composed projections, private public-page overlays, explicit StudySession/Review/Repair domain objects, capability-driven entitlement UI, cross-device orchestration, and release-blocking integration tests.
- Baseline repository committed on `main`; recovery commands and continuity state reconciled to repository reality.
- V1 jurisdiction posture made explicit: national NextGen UBE only, with no jurisdiction collection or dependency in onboarding, recommendations, analytics, assessment generation, or readiness.

## Completed in M1.1/M1.1a
- npm-workspace monorepo boundaries for `apps/backend`, `apps/web`, `apps/native`, and seven shared TypeScript packages.
- Django 5.2.17/DRF 3.16 environment-separated settings with PostgreSQL as the real-environment contract, a PostgreSQL CI/test setting, and SQLite isolated to foundation tests.
- Versioned `/api/v1/health/` and database-backed `/api/v1/ready/` endpoints with automated tests.
- One deduped React/ReactDOM 19.2.3 web runtime with a real root-shell mount test, and Expo SDK 57.0.12/React Native 0.86.2 native proof shell. The native destination buttons remain simulated local state, not navigation parity.
- TypeScript remains on the controlling 5.x line at 5.9.3 through Expo's supported dependency-validation exclusion.
- Hash-verified pip-tools production/development locks, npm 11 lock/install-script policy, per-surface lint environments, ES2022-only shared-package type environments, and an explicit portability gate.
- Node 24.19.0/npm 11.17.0 and Python 3.13.15 are aligned in version files, package metadata, CI, and setup documentation.
- Forced portrait orientation removed. Proper native routing/deep links remain later Milestone 1 foundation work.

## Tests actually run
- `python3 scripts/validate_continuity.py` passes against the committed repository baseline and controlling-spec manifest.
- Clean hash-verified Python lock installation passes on exact Python 3.13.15; Django 5.2.17 system check and 2 health/readiness tests pass on isolated SQLite and on a temporary local PostgreSQL 14 cluster after applying all built-in migrations. CI uses Python 3.13.15 and PostgreSQL 17.
- Clean `npm ci`, ESLint, Prettier, all TypeScript workspace typechecks, three Vitest tests (including the ReactDOM mount), the portability gate, and the Vite production build pass on exact Node 24.19.0/npm 11.17.0.
- `npm ls react react-dom --all` resolves only React 19.2.3; the built web asset contains only that React patch marker.
- Expo dependency compatibility reports current, Expo Doctor passes 20/20, and iOS/Android production JS exports pass on exact Node 24.19.0. Simulator/device/store builds remain unverified because Xcode, Android SDK/adb, and EAS are not configured on this host.
- Remaining npm audit findings are upstream Expo/React Native build/config-tool paths documented in `SECURITY_ADVISORIES.md`; no forced downgrade was applied.

## Providers actually verified
None yet in an implementation environment. Do not infer provider readiness from product specs.

## Known risks
Execution breadth remains the principal engineering risk. Curriculum completeness depends on automated official-scope/rule compilation, authority provenance, lawful multi-source reconciliation, subject certification, and strict inventory gates. NCBE Sourcebooks are optional enhanced reconciliation when lawfully available; do not make purchase/access a build or launch dependency.

## Exact next task
Execute **M1.2 — runtime and environment foundation**: add the specification-required Celery/managed-KVS skeleton and local/review/staging runtime pipeline. Keep business tasks, authentication, providers, and later product features out of that slice.

## Resume commands
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_continuity.py
cd apps/backend && ../../.venv/bin/ruff check . && ../../.venv/bin/python manage.py check --settings=config.settings.test && ../../.venv/bin/pytest
npm run check
npm run portability
npm run doctor --workspace @barclimb/native
```
Use Python 3.13.15, Node 24.19.0, and npm 11.17.0 for baseline parity. Install Python requirements with `--require-hashes`. See `../implementation/ENVIRONMENT.md` for setup and the PostgreSQL smoke path. Expo Doctor requires network access for all checks.

## Final integration note
Before feature UI implementation, establish the canonical provider-agnostic billing domain, server projection schemas, orchestration models/state machines, and client-surface capability manifest. These prevent Visitor/Free/Plus and Web/iOS/Android from diverging.
