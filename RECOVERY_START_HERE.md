# BarClimb Recovery — Start Here

This repository must be sufficient to resume BarClimb with **zero chat history**.

Controlling release sequence: **Web GA → iOS Native GA → Android Native GA**. Web-first never means Web-only: shared server/domain truth and explicit native architecture/parity obligations begin in Milestone 1.

1. Run `python3 scripts/validate_continuity.py` (or execute the script directly on systems where its Python 3 shebang is honored).
2. Read `docs/specs/SPEC_MANIFEST.json` and the four controlling specs only as needed.
3. Read `docs/project/PROJECT_STATE.json`.
4. Read `docs/project/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`.
5. For context, consult `BUILD_HISTORY.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `TEST_LEDGER.md`, `PROVIDER_STATUS.md`, `CLIENT_PARITY.md`, and `SECURITY_ADVISORIES.md`.
6. Follow `docs/project/RECOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md`.
7. Continue from **Exact next task** in the handoff.

M1.4 is accepted in `main` at `443bbbc849049d515d9c9b1797cd7909f50359f9`, with exact-main Foundation CI green. M1.5 local acceptance passes on `m1-5-assessment-presentation-proof`; exact-commit CI, review, and merge remain pending. It proves a shared assessment presentation/workspace contract only; it does not begin curriculum, production assessment, grading, evidence, or Milestone 2 work. Apple enrollment/signing, physical-device authentication/SecureStore, live OS association routing, store ownership/approval, and native production purchase/restore remain mandatory at the applicable Native GA and are not marked verified.

If prose conflicts with repository reality, investigate and correct the continuity docs before new architecture work. Never reconstruct missing history from guesses.
