| Date | Scope | Environment | Command / Method | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-12 | Continuity bootstrap | local artifact | `python scripts/validate_continuity.py` | PASSED | No application tests exist yet. |
## 2026-08-13 — Pre-build specification checks
- Verified four controlling Markdown specs are present and rehashed in `SPEC_MANIFEST.json`.
- Checked Build Constitution numbered headings for duplicate milestone/section numbers after milestone revision.
- Checked for stale “all nine milestone” / old Milestone 9 hardening language.
- Continuity validator must pass on the regenerated bootstrap before delivery.
- Added consistency requirement that release coverage counts only independently confirmed AssessmentScopeTargets, not GenerationSpecification tags alone.
