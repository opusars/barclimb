# BarClimb Recovery — Start Here

This repository must be sufficient to resume BarClimb with **zero chat history**.

Controlling release sequence: **Web GA → iOS Native GA → Android Native GA**. Web-first never means Web-only: shared server/domain truth and explicit native architecture/parity obligations begin in Milestone 1.

1. Run `python3 scripts/validate_continuity.py` (or execute the script directly on systems where its Python 3 shebang is honored).
2. Read `docs/specs/SPEC_MANIFEST.json` and the four controlling specs only as needed.
3. Read `docs/project/PROJECT_STATE.json`.
4. Read `docs/project/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`.
5. For context, consult `BUILD_HISTORY.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `TEST_LEDGER.md`, `PROVIDER_STATUS.md`, `CLIENT_PARITY.md`, and `SECURITY_ADVISORIES.md`.
6. Follow `docs/project/RECOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md`.
7. Continue from **Exact next task** in the handoff.

The Web-first amendment is accepted in `main` and amended main is merged normally into `m1-4-staging-auth-client-proof`; that M1.4 branch remains intentionally unmerged from main. Continue M1.4 only from its exact next task and blockers. Do not begin M1.5 first.

If prose conflicts with repository reality, investigate and correct the continuity docs before new architecture work. Never reconstruct missing history from guesses.
